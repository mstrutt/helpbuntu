	<h2>What is HelpBuntu?</h2>	
	<p>HelpBuntu is the clever combination of "help" and "Ubuntu". Enssentially it's a support site for all things Linux related, with a specific focus on Ubuntu. More recently I have added specific support categories for the Nokia N900 phone, and the MeeGo opperating system. All the advice given is based off the personal experiences of the founder and creator, Michael Strutt, upholding the values of the site's original motto: "Advice based on experience, not hear-say".</p>

	<h2>What is Ubuntu?</h2>
	<p>"Ubuntu is a fast, secure and easy-to-use operating system used by millions of people around the world." - <a href="http://ubuntu.com">ubuntu.com</a>. Ubuntu is a computer opperating system, much like the more commonly known Mac or Windows, however Ubuntu is quite different. It's based off Linux a highly powerful, and completely free, core system.</p>
