	<h2>How to get in contact</h2>
	
	<p>At the moment I am working on a better system for the contact section of the site, so for now if you need to get in touch, you can <a href="http://twitter.com/helpbuntu">tweet @helpbuntu</a>. I try to check twitter quite frequently, so I should be able to reply faily swiftly (time difference permitting).</p>
