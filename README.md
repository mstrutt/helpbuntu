sourcecode for http://helpbuntu.mstrutt.co.uk

This was one of my first websites so figured after a bit of housekeeping it would be nice to open source it and have the code available (mainly for nostalgia).

The code is quite outdated (read: I don't make these mistakes anymore), and while it's not something I'm actively developing, it's a nice reminded of where I came from
