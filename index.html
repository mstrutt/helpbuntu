<h3>A New Site is Coming</h3>

<p><a>HelpBuntu has started work on a new site. We feel that this one has become slightly outdated and no-longer matches the new corperate image of Ubuntu. We aim to have the new site live in time for the release of Ubuntu 11.4 (in April).</a></p>

<p><a>The new version of the site is available to view in it's testing state at </a><a href="testing" target="blank">helpbuntu.mstrutt.co.uk/testing</a><a> so if you want to have a little nosey you can. If you could leave feedback that would really help, afterall it is all about the community. Feedback can be  via the </a><a href="testing/?page=Contact" target="blank">New Contact Form</a><a> or on twitter </a><a href="http://twitter.com/helpbuntu">@helpbuntu</a><a>, whichever is more convenient.</a></p>

<a><b>What is HelpBuntu?</b> - HelpBuntu is a support site, created and administered by Michael Strutt, for Ubuntu - the Linux operating system. The site contains Frequently Asked Questions for common problems, along with tutorials and useful reference guides. A piece I am particularly proud of is the </a><a href="./metapixel.html">Metapixel Generating Engine</a><a> for creating photo-mosaics. If nothing else on the site solves your problem then you can send in your problem via the </a><a href="./contact.html">contact page</a><a> and get support from the HelpBuntu team.</a>

<br><br>

<a><b>So what is Ubuntu?</b> - Ubuntu is an operating system, like the more commonly known Mac of Windows, however unlike these it is based on Linux. Linux is a free disk operating system (the main set of commands that control the computer) and Ubuntu is one of the many versions of desktop environments written for Linux. It is free with good community support (and support sites such as this one) and updates are regularly provided to download at your leisure. To see how to install it, see </a><a href="./installation.html">my installation page</a><a>.</a>

<br><br>

<a><b>What about Software?</b> - Most commercially sold software will not work on Ubuntu (though there are programs such as WINE that might) but they are not needed. There is a vast supply of free software to cater for every need. A directory of all the main software available software to install is available from the main menu and lots of outsider applications also freely distributed. I have compiled a list of some of the best on </a><a href="./applications.html">my applications page</a><a>.</a>

<br><br>

<a><b>What will this help cost me</b> - Absolutely nothing. Helpbuntu upholds the Ubuntu belief that all this should be free. However if you feel you would like to help with the running costs of 30GBP per year then please spare what you can by clicking on the donate button at the top of any page. The payment is secured by PayPal and accepts most Credit/Debit Cards as well as other methods of payment.</a>
